# Eyx

Developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect various eye diseases, including Cataract, Glaucoma, Uveitis, and Conjunctivitis. Adapted the VGG-19 pre-trained CNN architecture for each specific disease, highlighting the adaptability of deep learning models to different eye diseases and their potential for multi-disease detection. Implemented Explainable AI for explaining the output of the model and utilized blockchain technology to encrypt the data (eye images) during transfer from frontend to backend and vice versa.
